# Reebot-in-Python
This is a short program in Python to build a ChatBot.

It is easy to make and simple enough to do without needing any external software downloads or installations. You can use Google Collab or any other online ML tool to do this. 

There are several other types of ChatBots which are more interactive and accurate, this is an example of a low-level ChatBot which has pre-defined and not so accurate answers.
